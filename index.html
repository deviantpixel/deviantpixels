<p>I have to know how everything works from end to end. That’s how it all started. That’s how it still is. This has led me through many different walks in life and here I am now, walking towards the ends of software and web design. Its exponential growth is a testament to why I still travel this path. Paired with my desire to help others it was only a matter of time before it evolved into a service to provide the best of what I have learned through the variable of my mind to do great works. I have engaged design desires of many different minds from complex groups to uniquely dynamic individuals in my quest along this path. Each creation growing both strength of software and design as well as strength of each entity it represents. It has been incredibly rewarding to know that I was not only able to encapsulate the life of each client into my works, but saw a life of my own evolution filter in as well. On the Portfolio page are a few of my recent works and an archive of thanks to those that have allowed me to bring their thoughts to life.</p>
